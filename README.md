##OOT-Exercises

Each exercise is written under seperate packages, namely: exercise1, exercise2, exercise3, exercise4.

Class diagrams for all the exercise may be found in the "class diagram" folder. In addition, the class digrams are placed individually alongside their implementations (java source files).
